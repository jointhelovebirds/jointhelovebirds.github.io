A few travel tips!
=====================================

Barcelona has become very touristy in the last few years. We recommend doing some research, and booking tickets in advance if you want to avoid long queues for some of the more famous attractions.

Sagrada Familia
----------------------------------

Book your ticket in advance if you want to avoid the queue. There can be at least a few hours wait if you don’t come prepared.

Montjuïc Cable Car
----------------------------------
Hop on board the Montjuïc cable car and enjoy breathtaking views of the city and the sea from the castle. With brand-new cabins that can seat up to eight people, this is the ideal way to enjoy Barcelona’s green lung with the family.

Gaudi architecture
----------------------------------
Casa Mila, Casa Batllo, and Park Guell are all recommended. Most of these places are getting longer queues. If you have a strong interest to visit - book in advance!

Modern architecture fun facts

 * Montjuïc Communications Tower designed by Calatrava
 * Fish sculpture designed by Richard Meier
 * Torre Agbar by Jean Nouvel

Free Barcelona
----------------------------------
There are loads of places to explore. Barcelona has lots of beautiful streets and architecture. Be on the lookout for pick-pocketters. If you have wandering eyes, a pick-pocketter may have already gone into your bag. Be-aware! Specially around high traffic areas such as Las Ramblas.

Barcelona Metro Travel
-----------------------------------------
This is a 10-pass ticket, usually costs around 10 euros, and can be used for
large parties (swiping the same ticket multiple times).
