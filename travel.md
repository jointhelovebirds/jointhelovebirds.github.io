===============================

Accommodation:
--------------------------------
Since we have such a variety of groups of coming, we didnâ€™t want to restrict hotels selections for our guests. See some recommendations below that may suit your budget and personalities:

 * [Airbnb.com](http://www.airbnb.com/Barcelona): For the traveler who wants to rent unique places from a local host.
 * [Tripadvisor.com](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Barcelona): For the traveler who wants more options to choose from.
 * [HostelWorld](http://www.hostelworld.com/Barcelona): For the budget traveler.

Flights:
--------------------------------
If you are traveling from abroad, [Google Flights](http://google.com/flights) finds really competitive prices.

Traveling around Europe:
--------------------------------
Recommended Budget airlines:

 * [Ryanair](http://www.rynair.com): This is going to be a cheap flight and known to get you there on time. Be aware why they are so cheap. Read all the fine print after booking. They will try to charge you for everything from printing a flight ticket to carry on that exceed 10kg.
 * [Easyjet](http://www.easyjet.com): This is another recommended budget airline. Very similar to the Ryanair experience above.

Traveling around Spain via train:
--------------------------------

 * [Renfe](http://www.renfe.com/EN/viajeros/index.html) is the local railway
company. You can find all routes and timetables on their websites.
